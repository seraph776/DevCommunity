This is my ImportantFile!
There are many like it, but this one is mine.
My Important File is my best friend.
It is my life.
I must master it as I must master my life. 
My ImportantFile, without me, is useless.
Without my ImportantFile, I am useless.
I must have access to my ImportantFile.
I must protect my ImportantFile greater than my enemy who is trying to encrypt it.
I must protect my ImportantFile before he encrypts it.
I will...
