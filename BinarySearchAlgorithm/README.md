## üí°Overview
The basic steps to perform Binary Search algorithm are:

- Begin with the mid element of the whole array as a search key.
- If the value of the search key is equal to the item then return an index of the search key.
- Or if the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, narrow the interval to the lower half.
- Otherwise, narrow it to the upper half.
- Repeatedly check from the second point until the value is found or the interval is empty.
